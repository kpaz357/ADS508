## Abstract:  
NexTrend Retail Co is facing challenges in optimizing inventory management across its online and physical stores, leading to frequent stockouts and excess inventory. Addressing this issue will improve customer satisfaction and increase profitability. 

## Problem Statement:  
NexTrend Retail Co has seen a significant rise in both online and in-store sales, but their inventory management system struggles to keep up with fluctuating demand patterns. The company frequently experiences product stockouts in high-demand regions and overstock situations in others. This inefficiency results in lost sales opportunities and increased storage costs. Given NexTrend's rapid growth, predicting purchasing behavior and improving inventory forecasting has become crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. 

## Goals:  
Develop a predictive model to forecast product demand across different store locations and online platforms. 
Implement an inventory optimization strategy to reduce stockouts and minimize overstock scenarios. 
Improve sales forecasting accuracy using historical sales data. 
Create a dashboard for real-time inventory monitoring and alerts. 

## Non-Goals: 
Developing a customer-facing recommendation system. 
New design for NexTrendâ€™s e-commerce platform or mobile app. 
Analyzing marketing campaign effectiveness other than its impact on inventory. 
Implementing major changes to supplier logistics or warehouse processes. 
Building a full-scale customer loyalty prediction model.
